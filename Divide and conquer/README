Solve the problem of dividing an integer array into two subarrays

The set a consisting of n positive integers is known

Now we want to divide it into two disjoint subsets A1, A2

Meet:

The difference in the number of elements between the two subsets is the smallest

The difference between the sum of the elements of the two subsets is the largest


求解一个整数数组划分为两个子数组的问题
	已知由n个正整数构成的集合a
	现在要将其划分为两个不相交的子集a1,a2
	满足：
		两个子集的元素个数相差最小
		两个子集的元素之和相差最大
